# Credit Card Fraud Detection

A machine learning project to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using Random Forest classification and handling of imbalanced data.

## Overview
This project implements a fraud detection model that:
- Uses Random Forest for classification
- Addresses class imbalance with SMOTE oversampling
- Provides comprehensive evaluation metrics

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- imbalanced-learn

## Usage
1. Place your transaction dataset at "D:/archive.zip"
2. Run the main script:
```python
python fraud_detection.py
```

## Model Details
- **Algorithm**: Random Forest with balanced class weights
- **Sampling**: SMOTE to handle class imbalance
- **Evaluation**: Classification report with precision, recall, and F1-score
